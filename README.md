## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### What I learned

This is a project I decided to finish so I can practice HTML, CSS and JS. I decided not to do it with React because I wanted to practice vanilla JavaScript.

I remember trying to do it after 2 or 3 months of studying web development and it was a mess!

I feel happy now that I can do it without much effort even though some parts - like that header styling - is still tricky.

### Useful resources
